                </h1>
                <p>
      Not much is known about the beginning of Dethklok, except for that the original lineup was consisted of four of the current members and rhythm guitarist Magnus Hammersmith. Somehow, they found a man named Charles Foster Ofdensen to act as the band's manager, and eventually they signed a contract with Crystal Mountain Records, much to the dismay of Damien Cornickelson, the only son of Crystal Mountain Records CEO Roy Cornickelson.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      During its years, Dethklok experienced a rapid increase in commercial success, and quickly became the biggest and most successful band of all time. Their wealth and power allowed them to have their own headquarters, Mordhaus, as well as an entire army of roadies, called Klokateers. Eventually, Dethklok's popularity gained the attention of a government agency called the Tribunal, who realized that there may be a connection between Dethklok and the apocalypse. Sometime early in this period, Magnus Hammersmith had a falling out with the other band members, and was eventually replaced by Toki Wartooth.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      It is unknown about Dethklok's discography before Metalocalypse, but the first known Dethklok album is called Dethwater, which is an album intended for fish only. Anticipation following up to Dethwater caused massive amounts of deaths everywhere by eager Dethklok fans. However, Dethwater provoked much controversy, such as a Dethklok fan nearly drowning after listening to the song "Go into the Water" and literally going into the water, thinking he'll devolve into a fish, and afterwards Dethklok was sued by the fan's parents. Due to this, Dethklok decided not to play the album live for a long time, but when they did, they were attacked by the forces of General Crozier.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      After the attack, Dethklok remained out of the public eye for a long time, until they finally came out of the shadows and performed a new song, "Laser Cannon Deth Sentence", while executing multiple prisoners. Soon after, scientists working for Dethklok developed a powerful analog recording system that recorded the tracks into water. However, some of Dethklok's enemies sought revenge on Dethklok, and banded together, calling themselves the Revengencers. Soon, the Revengencers began making attacks on Dethklok, first by assassinating the head of Dethklok Australia, then by bombing multiple stores of Duncan Hills Coffee, the world's largest coffee company whom Dethklok endorses. The Revengencers made their ultimate attack on Dethklok when they released their new album (presumably Dethalbum II), with casualties including Mordhaus, several Klokateers, and most importantly, Ofdensen.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      After the Revengencers' attack, Dethklok again remained out of the public eye, having Mordhaus relocated up in the sky while reconstruction was underway in order to prevent any further attack. Now self-managed, Dethklok began experiencing a massive financial crisis, not just because of the recession at that time, but also because of Dethklok's inability to spend money smartly. Meanwhile, at Crystal Mountain Records, Damien Cornickelson took over as CEO, replacing his father, Roy, who is currently in a coma. Damien blocked off all money made by Dethklok from the band, causing their money to dwindle further. It wasn't until Ofdensen's reappearance when the financial crisis was solved. Dethklok celebrated the end of it by performing their largest, most brutal concert to date.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      After accused of selling out, Dethklok disappeared from the public eye for a third time, and joined a tribute band called Thunderhorse in order to get back to their roots. However, after suffering from hunger and sleep issues, Dethklok abandoned Thunderhorse and went back to Dethklok. Dethklok was soon put in jeopardy twice: first during a death scare when drummer Pickles was reported to have been dying, and when lead guitarist Skwisgaar Skwigelf quit the band to find his father, although the death scare was proven to be false, and Skwisgaar accepted his role as a "god", putting his personal issues behind. Recently Dethklok almost put the entire world under WWIII when they accidently book two concerts for bitter state enemies Israel and Syria at the same time, without Ofdensen's knowledge. An angry Ofdensen blames Dethklok for almost causing global devastation and, emotionally hurt, the band members run away; unfortunately, on the day they were supposed to perform. However, Ofdensen reconciles with the band after he realizes his mistakes, and together he and Dethklok make Israel and Syria have peace with each other by doing a combined concert, averting yet another big disaster.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      Having accomplished the impossible yet again and with Mordhaus finally rebuilt, Dethklok made their triumphant return to the Earth's surface where the band's antics continued. During that time, Nathan attempts to date one of his semi-monogamous fans, Murderface makes an attempt at plastic surgery,Toki releases a tell-all book exposing years of enduring mental and verbal abuse from Skwisgaar, and another Dethklok album is produced in its analog water form. However, Nathan also begins experiencing strange dreams during this time, dreams involving being spoken to by a whale about the prophesized Metalocalypse. These visions, along with large consumptions of alcohol (specifically tequilla) persuade Nathan that the new album is wrong and must be destroyed. Therefore, despite a valiant attempt by Pickles to stop him, Nathan takes an axe to the master record while, at the same time, a series of massive hurricanes sink all of the ships transporting the new Dethklok album.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      With the loss of the new album, Dethklok tries to help the depressed world economy out any way they can, but a rift begins forming between Pickles and Nathan. While the two try to maintain their friendship, Toki goes off to RockARoonie Fantasy Camp to make friends and unintentionally bumps into Magnus Hammersmith, who is there as a guest councilor. Despite Magnus's tense expulsion from the band, he appears to bear Toki not a single grudge for taking his place and the rest of Dethklok soon reconcile with him in the same way. Meanwhile, the rift between Pickles and Nathan grows even more when Dick Knubbler is fired during the recording of another new album and is replaced by the beautiful yet no-nonsense ball buster, Abigail Remeltindrinc. Both Nathan and Pickles are infatuated with her beauty and fail to read the signs that she's declared herself off-limits in terms of their sexual prowess. These signs continue during the final stages of completing the new album in the Dethsub where the band is forbidden to jack-off due to symptoms of Carpal Tunnel Syndrome. This elevated sexual tension spreads throughout the sub, even to Abigail when her vibrator's batteries run out and, during the final recordings for the new album, breaks her own rule by getting involved with Nathan. Pickles, obviously, is not cool with this and announces his intentions to quit Dethklok during a promotional dinner for the new album.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      Blighted by this sudden chain of events, the other members of Dethklok also decide that their paths have seemingly drifted apart from one another and they announce their intension to disband, which results in worldwide panic among fans and mass public vandalism and destruction. Each member tries to go their own way; Murderface running for Senator from New Jersey (with Toki as his unpaid intern), Pickles opening his own winery, and Skwisgaar and Nathan starting their own soft jazz side project. All of these new career options fail one after another though and Pickles announces his willingness to rejoin the band if Nathan would apologize to him. During their farewell concert in Reykjavik, Iceland, both Nathan and Pickles struggle to find the will to apologize to one another when the band and their audience is suddenly attacked by the leader of the Tribunal, Mr. Selacia (A.K.A. the Half Man). The band is saved by Roy Cornickelson, who sacrifices himself in order to let the band escape to the Dethsub.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      Despite ever present strain and stress between them all, Dethklok stays together for their own safety and is escorted by Charles Ofdenson to the meeting place of the Church of the Black Klok, where he was originally brought back to heal after the raid on Mordhaus. There, the band is introduced to Ishnifus Meaddle, High Priest of the church and they learn that they have yet more to do with the outcome of the Metalocalypse, which includes making a new album to atone for the one Nathan destroyed. Reluctance keeps the band from reforming until the funeral of Roy Cornickelson where Nathan has been asked to give the eulogy. During his speech and despite doing internal damage to himself, Nathan overcomes his pride and apologizes to Pickles for everything. The band's reconciliation is short lived though when the funeral is ambushed by the Revengencers led by the mysterious Metal Masked Assassin. The massacre comes to a bloody conclusion, but not before Magnus betrays Toki by stabbing him through the back while another terrorist seemingly kills Abigail. Back on board the Dethsub once again, Ishnifus Meaddle suggests that Toki and Abigail are still alive but in the hands of their enemy.

                    <h3>Childhood</h3>
<p>Young Nathan, moments before a truck crashes into his classroom
Nathan was raised in New Port Richey, Florida, the sole child of Oscar, implied to have been in the military, and Rose Explosion. Nathan was a very quiet child to the point of being regarded as mute, and did not speak until the age of five. In Dethgov, when his classmates and teacher were killed after he won the election for class president in the second grade, Nathan remained virtually unaffected. He was an unremarkable student in high school, excelling only in frog dissection and football. He eventually dropped out without earning his diploma (though he tried to earn his GED years later).</p>
<br>
<h3>Dethklok</h3>
<p>Young Nathan at the signing of Dethklok
In Renovationklok, Nathan was present at the signing of the contract for Dethklok. When Roy Cornickelson's son, Damien Cornickelson, insulted him and his taste in music, Nathan responded with a violent punch to the face. Damien carried a grudge against him ever since. Shortly after this, Nathan and Magnus got into a disagreement over leadership of the band, and in a fit of rage, Magnus tried to murder him, stabbing him in the upper shoulder area of his back. Nathan beat him up in response and kicked him out of Dethklok permanently.</p>

<p>Despite Skwisgaar's objections, Dethklok was ordered to find a new rhythm guitarist. The band agrees that if no one can beat Skwisgaar's skill with the guitar, they will allow the band to go without a second guitar. All the applicants failed to match Skwisgaar's godly skill when a Norwegian teenager named Toki Wartooth arrives late to the audition. Though Toki was also no match for the Swedish guitarist, his potential and talent impressed Skwisgaar so much that he let him in Dethklok. That choice skyrocketed the band into untold wealth and fame, and its members became living legends. The name "Dethklok" became a chant universally echoed by fans throughout the entire world.</p>
<br>
<h3>Season 1</h3>
<p>Nathan studies for his GED, but fails when he neglects to answer any of the questions on the exam. He gives a speech to Harvard's graduating class about the meaninglessness of academic achievement.</p>

<p>Nathan starts to date an actress, Rebecca Nightrod, who his bandmates dislike because she is controlling toward Nathan and will not allow him to participate in their usual antics. Toki and the others literally torture Nathan until he agrees to dump her. However, she falls down several flights of stairs and into a coma, leading Nathan to declare her the ultimate girlfriend.</p>
<br>
<h3>Season 2</h3>
<p>Nathan attempts to get in touch with his roots after reading his grandmother's diary and discovering that he is in fact a quarter Amazonian in heritage. He leads an expedition into the Amazon jungle to make contact with the indigenous Yaneemango tribe, of whom Nathan's grandfather was a warrior chief. Dethklok discovers their faces have been carved into the mountainside by the Yaneemango, who worship Dethklok and treat them to exotic hallucinogenic drugs.</p>

<p>Nathan's home-state of Florida rises up against their anti-Dethklok governor, violently assassinating him and demanding Nathan as their new governor, which leads to a state of utter lawlessness and proves to be a disaster for everyone. Not knowing any other way to respond to the chaos, Dethklok plays a concert, which conjures a hurricane Nathan christens Scrambles: The Death Dealer. As they depart the state which is now in ruins Nathan determines that he has made it a better place, and is called "the best governor Florida ever had."</p>

<p>Rebecca cheats and breaks up with Nathan (despite being in an immobilizing coma) and Nathan decides to start dating again. This proves extremely challenging as his bandmates do everything they can to make his dates awkward and unsuccessful. Meanwhile, he is stalked by a woman named Lavona Succuboso, leader of an extremist group of female fans hoping to abduct Nathan and bear his children.</p>

<p>When Mordhaus is attacked by The Revengencers, Nathan discovers Toki trapped and barely conscious under some burning debris. He carries Toki to safety and takes the opportunity to tell him he is worried that Toki has become an alcoholic. He is also confronted by Lavona, who is knocked unconscious by Toki. Nathan also saves Offdensen from The Man With the Silver Face.</p>
<br>

<h3>Season 3</h3>
<p>Nathan struggles to keep the band safe during Offdensen's recovery period and extended absence, but the manager mysteriously reappears just in the nick of time, promising to explain later. Nathan continues to develop his leadership skills as well as his relationships with his bandmates and their manager, and experiences no major personal incidents for some time, with the exception of a scary dental appointment.

During the time Murderface is making a Christmas special with Knubbler, he's impressed William would actually stay with a project that long until he learns that the event is sponsored by the church and punches Murderface for lying.</p>
<br>
<h3>Season 4</h3>
<p>Nathan briefly sees a new girlfriend, Trindle, who is very clingy and fanatic about Dethklok in general. Nathan is infatuated with her looks and constant desire to please him. As usual, his bandmates dislike her and urge him to break up with her. He is later dismayed to learn she has been cheating on him and will hook up with anyone who looks like him. She commits suicide in front of the band by detonating an explosive device in an attempt to take them down with her.</p>

<p>Nathan adopts a new catchphrase, "That's doable!" This phrase can also be used in the negative, e.g. "That's SO not doable!"</p>

<p>Nathan is plagued by nightmares of an ocean goddess, a massive whale who warns him that there is something wrong with Dethklok's new record, which is soon to be released. His premonition coincides with worldwide storms which destroy all copies of the record being shipped. Just as he and Pickles are preparing to embark on an extravagant booze-fueled vacation, Nathan takes an axe to the final remaining copy of the record, destroying the unreleased songs forever and punching Pickles in the face in the process. This incident marks the beginning of the deterioration of his friendship with Pickles.</p>

<p>Following the loss of the record there is a lot of pressure on Nathan, and Offdensen dismisses Dick Knubbler in favor of a new producer, Abigail Remeltindrinc, hoping she will get the band back on track in terms of productivity. Nathan is at first taken aback by Abigail, who is not intimidated by him and speaks to him in a very frank manner. She teaches him a lesson by sending him on a no-frills trip to the Middle East, where Nathan and the band experience life without their various helpers and handlers arranging everything for them. The band finds themselves lost and hungry on the streets, and Pickles finally snaps and tells Nathan he is still angry at him about destroying the record and for the way he's been leading the band lately, a confrontation which is awkward for everyone. Just then the band is kidnapped, and Nathan has to write a new song in order to save them, ending his period of writer's block.</p>

<p>Nathan continues to act as a protective figure toward Toki, and takes concern over Toki's preparations to visit a summer camp. He gives Toki a snowglobe replica of Mordhaus to remind him of home, which Toki carries with him. When Toki is bullied at camp and the snowglobe is destroyed, Nathan becomes enraged, warning the bully, "Oh shit, kid! You just fucked up real bad!" before chasing him into the woods and mutilating his hand with the broken glass.</p>

<p>Offdensen orders Dethklok into seclusion in the Dethsub to force them to focus on music, at which point Nathan admits that he has become attracted to Abigail. Pickles also expresses interest in her and challenges Nathan over whom she prefers. Abigail rejects Pickles and the rest of the band's attempts to hit on her, but ends up hooking up with Nathan in a heated moment when they are left alone in the recording studio. She regrets breaking her moral policy against getting intimately involved with the musicians she works with, however, Nathan subsequently develops feelings for Abigail and confides in Skwisgaar that he intends to marry her. At a large dinner ceremony with Dethklok's record executives and distributors, Nathan publicly declares them a couple, shocking Abigail herself and infuriating Pickles, who calls him a "greedy, fat asshole" and quits the band on the spot.</p>

<p>Nathan stubbornly refuses to apologize to Pickles even though Abigail refuses to acknowledge him. He announces Dethklok's disbandment to the world, shocking everyone. He and Skwisgaar try to develop a new band concept with the help of Dick Knubbler, but are unable to find a good sound without simply imitating Dethklok. The Tribunal is concerned that The Prophecy has been disrupted and Mr Selatia reveals himself to them at their final concert in Iceland, murdering Roy Cornickelson in front of them. This prompts Offdensen to introduce the band to Ishnifus Meaddle, who explains The Prophecy to them and tells Nathan his premonition to destroy the record was correct. At Cornickelson's funeral Nathan has an emotional breakdown and apologizes to Pickles while delivering the eulogy speech. They hug and reconcile, but the band is suddenly attacked by The Revengencers and Toki and Abigail are kidnapped.</p>
<br>
<h3>The Doomstar Requiem</h3>
<p>Nathan and Dethklok indulge in booze, drugs, and antics to distract themselves from the fact that Toki is missing. Nathan continues to fantasize about Abigail although he is unsure if she is still alive. After much coaxing from Offdensen, Ishnifus, and Dethklok's followers, Nathan musters the courage to lead Dethklok into The Revengencers' hideout and save Toki and Abigail. The Man With the Silver Face and Magnus are finally vanquished, and Dethklok celebrates Toki's recovery with a large concert in his honor, during which Nathan proclaims Toki as a brother. Nathan and Abigail kiss passionately.</p>

                    <h3>Childhood</h3>

<p>William Murderface was raised by his grandparents Stella and Thunderbolt Murderface, after he lost his mother and father in a chainsaw murder-suicide, carried out in front of him by his father when William was just an infant. Although the baby Murderface didn't seem fazed by this as he was too immersed in eating and playing with his cereal; this memory is still traumatizing to him as an adult. While in high school, Murderface's principal allowed him to play bass, drink, and smoke dope to earn his high school diploma after Murderface threatened to cut his eyes out if he didn't let him graduate.</p>
<br>
<h3>Season 1</h3>
<p>Murderface's feelings are hurt when his bandmates tell him they did not get him anything for his birthday, however, this is later revealed to be a prank. They give him the assassination car of President John F. Kennedy (including the assassination chair of President Abraham Lincoln) which makes him so happy he cries a blood tear. He promptly demolishes the gift and relishes at the opportunity to "destroy United States history."</p>

<p>Murderface seeks religious inspiration after miraculously surviving a severe fall from the dethcycle. His change in behavior causes Dethklok to consider firing him from the band, and Skwisgaar even suggests killing him. After sampling the customs of numerous religions including The Church of Satan, he comes to the conclusion that all religions are the same -- "all just a bunch of boring crap." He returns to his hedonistic ways with the band.</p>
<br>
<h3>Season 2</h3>
<p>Murderface continues to master the art of "bein' a dick," demonstrating these skills to Nathan and Pickles by sparking a fight between Skwisgaar and Toki, leading to a falling out between the two. He later apologizes to them.</p>

<p>After much criticism from his bandmates regarding his lack of talent, Murderface attempts to write a song on acoustic guitar, which he never finishes because he smashes the instrument.</p>

<p>Murderface attempts to produce a "Nascar-type theatrical hybrid event" but struggles to handle the pressure and responsibility. On the night of the event he becomes incapacitated by a cocktail of drugs given to him by Pickles.</p>

<p>When Nathan is first attacked by Lavona Succuboso, Murderface blocks the attack by diving in front of Nathan with his bass, legitimately protecting him.</p>

<p>Murderface and Toki write and record a grunge rock song called Takin' It Easy, an accomplishment they are both very proud of until the song fails to impress their bandmates and the two are unable to agree on who deserves the most credit for the track.</p>

<p>Murderface does a good deed when he ushers attendees of a record release party to safety during an attack on Mordhaus.</p>
<br>
<h3>Season 3</h3>
<p>Murderface experiences sexual confusion after he becomes aroused during a health exam by a male doctor. He later concludes that the doctor intentionally aroused him.</p>

<p>With the help of Dick Knubbler, Murderface attempts to produce a TV Christmas special featuring Dethklok. The special is ultimately a disaster when the set is crashed by Dethklok's mothers and Doctor Rockzo. He is also punched in the face by Nathan, who is enraged to learn the event is being sponsored by the Church of Christian Churchology.</p>

<p>When Skwisgaar struggles to come to terms with his fatherless childhood, Murderface attempts to become closer to Skwisgaar in hopes it will give him a shot at Skwisgaar's mother, Serveta. He succeeds only in annoying Skwisgaar and infuriating Pickles, who becomes jealous of all the attention given to Skwisgaar. Murderface triggers Pickles's memory of being rejected by his own father, leading Pickles to beat Murderface up, along with Toki, who joins in the beating just for the fun.</p>

<p>Murderface challenges Skwisgaar's sexual prowess, betting he can sleep with as many women as Skwisgaar. The bet only results in several sexual harassment reports filed against Murderface and a steady stream of groupies into Skwisgaar's lap.</p>

<p>Murderface attempts to sue his bandmates for residual credits to Dethklok's albums, along with Toki, who ruins their claim in court by honestly admitting that they do not deserve the credit. Pickles, Nathan and Skwisgaar become annoyed with Murderface's constant attempts to take credit where it isn't due and drag Toki into his schemes, and they send him walking home to Mordhaus alone. He takes the opportunity to sing a heartfelt song about how nothing that requires any effort is worth doing. This leads to yet another scheme, and Murderface convinces Toki to start a record label with him. For once he actually tries to work hard, however, he comes to regret this when the talentless band he recruits mistreats him and takes credit for his work.<p>
<br>
<h3>Season 4</h3>
<p>Murderface briefly sports a thick mustache, leading to ridicule and exclusion from his bandmates.<p>

<p>Murderface revisits his old hobby of pranking Toki and Skwisgaar, leading to much confusion and embarrassment for the two Scandinavians. They get revenge on him by framing him as a terrorist, although they also incriminate themselves in the process.</p>

<p>When Toki visits a summer camp, Murderface takes the opportunity to hang out with Skwisgaar. The two enjoy a horror movie marathon and binge on sweets, activities they avoid when Toki is around due to his sensitive nature and diabetes. They later have a sleepover in Pickles's room after the horror movies give them the creeps.</p>

<p>Murderface wins the Brutalies Award for Most Brutal Looking Musician. His bandmates are quick to point out that he should take this not as an honor but as a public insult. Murderface quickly sinks into a deep depression and guilts Nathan into loaning him a large sum of money for plastic surgery. Though he insists Nathan keep his plans a secret, he reveals the secret when the band is shocked to see unflattering paparazzi photos of themselves on a celebrity gossip TV program. This sparks Nathan and the other three members to question their looks as well. Murderface tries to remain discrete and save money on his procedures by having the operations performed at an unlicensed under-the-table clinic in Tijuana, Mexico. When he shows up at the awards ceremony he sees his bandmates have also altered their appearances. He reveals his new face hoping to shock his friends and the audience with his 'Handsomeface', but to his dismay his face has become swollen and infected. Everyone flees in horror and Murderface screams as Skwisgaar throws hot coffee in his face.</p>

<p>In yet another bid for credit and attention, Murderface announces he is going to starve himself to death. This only results in him drinking heavily on an empty stomach and being punched in the face by Pickles.</p>

<p>When Dethklok temporarily disbands, Murderface takes an interest in politics and employs Toki as an intern. His political aspirations are ruined when Toki leaks Murderface's masturbation selfies onto the internet.</p>
<br>
<h3>The Doomstar Requiem</h3>
<p>When the search for Toki leads Dethklok to a bar called The Depths of Humanity, a member of The Revengencers intentionally scratches Murderface's arm with the poisoned spikes on his bracelet, while distracting him with compliments. Murderface's eyes go into a trance, but Nathan grabs him and they exit the bar. Later Murderface urges Dethklok to give up their quest, saying "We should make a run for it now, because if that was me inside, none of you would come to save me anyhow." Nathan assures him he would risk his life to save him as well, and they rescue Toki.</p>
<br>
<p>As Murderface sleeps, the mysterious poison is shown spreading through his veins, and his eyes glow.</p>

                    <h3>Childhood</h3>
<p>Skwisgaar sometimes makes allusions to having grown up poor, for example mentioning during an interview Food[4] that he was fed snow for breakfast as a child "when times was tough." He is the illegitimate only child of "Miss Sweden of 1956," Serveta Skwigelf; his father's identity is unknown due to his mother's promiscuity. One day, he came home from school to find his mother having sexual intercourse with two men. Traumatized, he ran away, catching the interest of four wolves, who promptly began chasing him. Shortly after that, he fell into a large hole in the ground and landed in a cave. In said cave was a frozen corpse with a bottle and a sword, and a statue of a Norse god holding a black Gibson Explorer with a white pickguard. Entranced by the guitar, he took it home and played it from that day forward.</p>
<br>
<h3>Prior to Dethklok</h3>
<p>As told during Snakes 'n' Barrels, Skwisgaar has been in a large number of bands prior to joining Dethklok, including Agnostic Priest, Gangagar, Eldele'el-Alele, Gognog Mug Alugdug, F*ckface Academy, Sausage Assassin, Financially Raped, and Smugly Dismissed, to name a few. He claims to have been in "pretty much every band." In an interview Skwisgaar mentions two side projects, a Harry Potter tribute band called 10 Points to Gryffindor, and a nudist Civil War styled band called Depantsification Proclamation.</p>
<br>
<h3>Dethklok</h3>
<p>Skwisgaar was present at the signing of the contract for Dethklok. After Magnus was kicked out of the band, Skwisgaar seized the opportunity to express desire to be Dethklok's only guitarist. The rest of the band agreed to do so only if they could not find another worthy guitarist. Skwisgaar proved his extraordinary talent to the band by besting over a thousand guitarists attempting to audition for the role. This lead them to proclaim him a Guitar God, however, a homeless teen by the name of Toki arrived late and begged for the opportunity to audition for them. Despite Toki's young age and tattered clothing, Skwisgaar decided to give him a chance on the merit that he "seems so nice."</p>

<p>Skwisgaar expected to defeat Toki easily, but they were all surprised when Toki was able to keep up with Skwisgaar in a call-and-response duel. When Toki finally cracked under the pressure and failed to complete a riff, the other members of Dethkok dismissed Toki, but Skwisgaar halted Toki from departing. Skwisgaar invited Toki into the band as he believed the duel had pushed his own abilities to a new level. Shortly after Toki joined, Dethklok rose to fame.</p>

<p>Skwisgaar appeared to have a less dominant role in the band prior to the expulsion of Magnus and the discovery of Toki. Despite Skwisgaar's superior abilities, Magnus appeared to have more of a lead role and more of a say during his time in the band, with Skwisgaar saying very little. After Magnus was fired, Skwisgaar sat apart from his bandmates during the meeting regarding whether or not to replace the fifth member. He also presented a distinct all-white aesthetic during his early days in Dethklok, but later adopted an outfit that is more in uniform with his bandmates.</p>
<br>
<h3>Season 1</h3>
<p>Skwisgaar attempts to produce a television special, at Toki's suggestion. During production his typically unconcerned and confident demeanor melts away due to stress and pressure. When Offdensen happens upon a tearful meltdown in his dressing room, he insists he was merely doing drugs. The other bandmembers antagonize the situation by gossiping about his emotional state and openly criticizing the production on its lack of 'zazz'. The TV special is ultimately a disaster when Skwisgaar has an allergic reaction and can barely play guitar on the night of the program. However, the oblivious public sees it as a bold new direction in guitar and copies the 'technique'. A news anchor states, "That night, the master of the guitar literally reinvented the instrument."</p>
<br>
<h3>Season 2</h3>
<p>Skwisgaar rejects Toki's request to take more solos, and is dismayed to learn Toki is taking guitar lessons from another tutor, resulting in a falling out between the two. He later apologizes to Toki.</p>

<p>Skwisgaar is arrested after a high-speed car chase. He is ordered to attend driving school along with bandmate Toki, who was firing a pistol from the passenger seat. During class the two are forced to watch a gruesome video containing graphic images of car crash scenes, instilling them with a deep fear of driving, and they subsequently fail their driving tests. Later they participate in a demolition dragrace.</p>
<br>
<h3>Season 3</h3>
<p>Skwisgaar orders a search for his biological father, and is dismayed to learn that although his mother had sex with thousands of men during the time of his conception, none of their DNA matches his. Skwisgaar is unable to dismiss his curiosity about the identity of the father he never had, and returns to his hometown in Sweden to make peace with his childhood and reconcile his relationship with his mother. Though it is difficult for him to adjust to civilian life, he even begins to form a relationship with his mother's new husband and takes a local girl out on a normal date. When Nathan attempts to persuade him to return to Dethklok, he chooses to remain in Sweden, despite Nathan's insistence that Skwisgaar was never meant to be a regular person. However, Skwisgaar is soon disappointed when he discovers his mother has been cheating on his step-father with multiple men and has not actually changed her past ways. As he flees his mother's home in Sweden he has the realization that he was immaculately conceived and is not a human man, but in fact, a descendant of the Gods. He returns home with Dethklok, and a renewed confidence in his role in the band.<p>

<p>During his soul-searching it is revealed that Skwisgaar was a young boy when he discovered his first guitar after falling into a hidden cave. The guitar was lodged within the frozen statue of a guitar god. Although a warrior's corpse lay nearby, Skwisgaar was able to remove the guitar easily and immediately began to excel at playing the instrument. It is shown that playing the guitar gave him comfort and happiness during his lonely childhood.</p>

<p>It is also revealed that despite his disgust with his mother's promiscuity and his own struggle with fatherlessness, Skwisgaar has fathered thousands of illegitimate children around the world which he has never met or even acknowledged, and has no intention to do so.</p>
<br>
<h3>Season 4</h3>
<p>After a series of pranks perpetrated against he and Toki, Skwisgaar seeks revenge upon Murderface by stealing his credit card and framing him as a terrorist. However, Skwisgaar's possession of Murderface's credit card and the fact that they followed him to the airport hoping to witness his takedown resulted in all three of them receiving harsh beatings.</p>

<p>Skwisgaar's friendship with Toki is tested once again when he writes a tell-all book entitled Skwisgaar Is Ams Dick in an appeal for more guitar solos. Much to the amusement of the rest of the band, Skwisgaar has another nervous breakdown. For the first time since Dethklok's rise to fame he experiences a lack of popularity, and he warns the rhythm guitarist, "Be carefuls what you wish fors... The audience ams a fickles mistress, Toki." As usual, Toki cracks under the pressure and cannot even plug in his guitar. Skwisgaar's prediction comes true and the audience begins to heckle. Skwisgaar mistakenly attempts to rescue Toki from his panic attack using a defibrillator, while their bandmates stand by and mock the situation.</p>
<br>
<h3>The Doomstar Requiem</h3>
<p>In the past Skwisgaar is presented wearing all white, with a Swedish flag belt buckle. He also wields a white Explorer. He is shown sitting off to the side apart from his American bandmates. His physical appearance is identical to his present day age, unlike the other band members who have aged noticeably since.</p>

<p>During a band meeting shortly after Magnus is fired, Skwisgaar states his desire to remain the sole guitarist in Dethklok, rather than hiring a replacement for the fifth band member. He is able to prove his superior abilities to his bandmates by swiftly defeating over a thousand hopeful auditioners. However, one last auditioner arrives late and introduces himself as Toki, a teenage boy from Norway. He begs for a chance to play with Skwisgaar and a lengthy guitar battle ensues. Though Toki is inevitably bested by Skwisgaar and dismissed by the band, Skwisgaar meets Toki outside and explains that nobody else has ever made him play so well. He invites Toki to join the band, and Dethklok rises to fame and fortune shortly afterward. As Toki grows up and settles into his role in the band Skwisgaar agrees, "Everything am better now dat he ams in de band dis times."</p>

<p>After Toki is kidnapped, Dethklok's search leads them to a bar called the Depths of Humanity, where Toki played his first gig with the band. Skwisgaar notices an audition flier on the wall and remembers the warehouse where he and Toki had their first guitar battle. He realizes this must be the place Magnus has imprisoned Toki, which leads to his rescue.</p>

                    <h3>Childhood</h3>
<p>Toki was born and raised in an abandoned village near Lillehammer and is the only child of Aslaug and Anja Wartooth. Toki's father is a Reverend in a mysterious and seemingly cult-like religion which apparently involves taking a vow of silence or similar discipline. As a small child, Toki was ordered to do grueling physical work on his parents' mill. He was frequently beaten and punished with solitary confinement. During that time he took comfort in his imagination.</p>

<h3>Joining Dethklok</h3>
<p>When Toki was a teenager, his parents threw him out. He lived on the streets with just his guitar, having no food, money, or shelter. He found out about Dethklok's audition for a new guitarist and took himself along.</p>

<p>He arrives late to the audition, just as the band was about to accept Skwisgaar as the only guitarist. Skwisgaar refused to allow himself to be beaten by just a kid and the two began their guitar duel. Toki kept up with Skwisgaar throughout the duel, but messed up at the end causing him to lose the duel and the other bandmembers dismissed him. However, on his way out, Skwisgaar states that he is impressed as no one has ever pushed him to play so well before. In short, Toki was allowed to join the band as their second guitarist.</p>

<p>After Toki's recruitment, Dethklok rose to fame and fortune. Toki in turn states their success brought him a sense of family that he never felt before.</p>
<br>
<h3>Season 1</h3>
<p>Toki is first established as a diabetic after an intense candy binge threatens his health. He takes this in stride, stating, "They should makes insulin-flavored candy. Whatever."</p>

<p>Toki laments his role as "the cutesy guy what kids like" and adopts a new, more brutal demeanor, causing his bandmates to question his sanity. When a little girl with a dying wish to meet him writes him a song, he has a flashback to his own childhood and regrets his refusal to see her. He runs to meet her only to find she has just died, leading him to blame himself for her death.</p>

<p>Toki forms a friendship with Dr Rockzo, a washed-up rock & roll clown with a penchant for cocaine. Though his bandmates disapprove of the clown, Toki's more accepting nature leads him to give the clown a chance.</p>

<p>While performing Go into the Water live on stage, Toki and Skwisgaar are separated from the rest of the band and cornered by the Metal Masked Assassin. Just as they believe they are about to be killed, they are rescued by Charles.</p>
<br>
<h3>Season 2</h3>
<p>Tired of living in Skwisgaar's shadow, Toki seeks the help of a new guitar tutor, Dimneld Selftcark. The lessons prove to be ineffective as Toki is more interested in making friends with the old man than actually practicing his guitar. When Skwisgaar discovers Toki with Dimneld, he is infuriated and threatens to ban Toki from Dethklok. Toki goes on to perform a guitar recital, but cracks under the pressure. Skwisgaar apologizes for his jealous ways and Toki's tutor dies.</p>

<p>Toki attempts to help Dr. Rockzo give up his addictions and aids him in getting through rehab.</p>

<p>Toki and Skwisgaar are ordered to attend driving school after a drunken police chase. In class they are shown gruesome crash scene footage, instilling them with a fear of driving. They later participate in a demolition dragrace driving "doubleneck guit-cars."</p>

<p>Toki learns his father is dying of cancer, forcing him to confront his abusive childhood. He struggles to overcome his past and attempts to fulfill his father's dying wish, however, just as Toki forgives his father and lays him to rest at his birthplace, he slips and the old man slides into the icy lake below. Toki watches in horror as his father drowns and sinks into the darkness. The Tribunal describes Toki as "an angel of death" due to the streak of deaths plaguing those who come in contact with him, his bandmates being the obvious exception to this.</p>

<p>Toki's repressed anger is unleashed when a random concertgoer continually pesters him. Toki snaps and physically assaults the man, giving him a savage beating in disproportion for the man's offence, perhaps killing him. The incident frightens even his bandmates.</p>

<p>Toki develops alcoholic behavior, spending his days in a drunken stupor. His bandmates mock his antics and debate whether or not to show genuine concern, which they've agreed in the past never to do. During an attack on Mordhaus, Nathan finds Toki pinned under some fallen debris and rescues him. He takes the opportunity to tell Toki he cares about him and to lay off the alcohol. When Nathan is attacked by Lavona Succuboso, Toki defends Nathan by smashing his beer bottle over her head, knocking her out.</p>
<br>
<h3>Season 3</h3>
<p>Toki seems to recover after his downward spiral, and like the other bandmates has to deal with the loss of their manager. He is the only one to openly admit he misses Charles during his extended absence, something he confides in Pickles.</p>

<p>Toki is discovered posing as Skwisgaar in the Dethklok cover band Thunderhorse, to which Skwisgaar remarks, "That's why my pants and shirts keeps disappearing!" He calls Toki weird but does not object to their switching roles temporarily.</p>

<p>Toki attempts to get his bandmates into the holiday spirit, having Mordhaus decorated for Christmas and buying gifts for everyone. When he realizes the gifts have been pawned by Dr. Rockzo for drug money, he angrily confronts the clown on the set of Murderface and Knubbler's live holiday special. Coincidentally, Stella Murderface knocks over a stage prop at that moment, a large crucifix which pins Toki down.</p>

<p>Toki's bandmates present him with a selection of groupies as a birthday present. Toki declines their offer and expresses his interest in finding a wife to raise children with. He scolds them for being shallow and seeks the help of a dating agency, however, the agency matches him with a woman so unappealing he starts to question his own values. After some soul-searching and words of advice from Pickles and Nathan, he flees from his "ladymate" and returns to Mordhaus to partake in his birthday present.</p>

<p>Toki joins Murderface in a class action lawsuit against the other band members over songwriting residuals (though Toki has no idea what this means), which ultimately leads to both of them being put on musical suspension. They attempt to prove themselves by starting Murdertooth Records with the Nu Metal band Get Thee Hence, however, Toki fouls up any chance to gain writer's credits when he fills out the songwriting contracts in Norwegian. Despite this, Toki and Murderface are allowed back into Dethklok just in time for Get Thee Hence to open for Dethklok, an action which turns bloody when the crowd turns on the Nu Metal band for their bad attitudes and sloppy performance. Dethklok watches in shock offstage, though Toki appears to be the only one unaffected by it all.</p>

<p>Toki attempts to reunite Dr. Rockzo's band, Zazz Blammymatazz. The project is threatened by surfacing rumors about Dr. Rockzo's past with an underage girl, and by Toki's cripping phobia of bicentennial quarters, leading him to take another look into the past as well. While Toki struggles with this, his bandmates take over much of the Zazz Blammymatazz reunion project. Things go off without a hitch, however, the stage is destroyed when Toki's phobia is triggered and he haphazardly starts a fire.</p>

<p>Toki develops a childlike habit of punching his bandmates in the shoulder for attention, bruising and annoying them in the process. Later, Toki and the band run away after Charles scolds them and they believe he does not care about them anymore. When Charles finds the band he comforts Toki and disciplines him regarding his hitting habit.</p>
<br>
<h3>Season 4</h3>
<p>Toki briefly takes up smoking cigarettes as a habit along with the rest of the band.</p>

<p>After being excluded from several group activities, Toki starts his own Special Persons Invite Club and sends a special text message invite to all bandmates except Murderface, effectively giving the bassist a taste of his own medicine. Toki ultimately ends up being excluded from his own club event, and unknowingly humiliating his bandmates by designing club uniforms which strikingly resemble the KKK's.</p>

<p>Toki and Skwisgaar seek revenge against Murderface after a series of embarrassing pranks perpetrated against the two Scandinavians, the most humiliating of all being a botched attempt to visit Splash-A-Roonie Water Park.</p>

<p>After being denied yet another coveted solo, Toki writes a tell-all book about his years of verbal abuse from Skwisgaar, entitled Skwisgaar Is Ams Dick. The book leads to another tiff between the two, and a significant loss in popularity and endorsements for the Swede. When Toki finally usurps a much anticipated solo at a Scandinavian Ice Festival, Skwisgaar warns him, "De audience ams a fickles mistress, Toki." As usual, Toki cracks under the pressure and has a panic attack on stage. Skwisgaar uses a defibrillator to "save" Toki.</p>

<p>Toki attends Rock-A-Roonie Fantasy Camp in hopes of making some friends outside of the band. His innocence and diabetic status make him an instant target for bullying. He finds an unlikely friend in guest counselor and former Dethklok member Magnus Hammersmith, who injects Toki with insulin when he's smothered with cake.</p>

<p>Toki develops a strong online following via his "FaceFriends" profile, where he posts backstage pics and updates about his activities with Dethklok as well as Dr. Rockzo. Rockzo and Toki drunkenly crash an important dinner with Dethklok's record executives.</p>

<p>When Dethklok temporarily disbands, Toki attempts to work as Murderface's unpaid intern when he runs for Congressman for New Jersey, which backfires when Toki accidentally emails lewd pictures of Murderface to the press. During this time, he continues his ties with Magnus despite Dr. Rockzo's harsh warnings about him.</p>

<p>These warnings are justified when Toki is betrayed by Magnus at the funeral of Roy Cornickelson. The Revengencers launch an ambush against Dethklok, during which Magnus literally stabs Toki in the back, taking him hostage. Ishnifus Meaddle assures Dethklok that the Church of the Black Klok believes Toki has survived, however, his whereabouts are unknown.</p>
<br>
<h3>The Doomstar Requiem</h3>

<p>Toki is crucified in a Petrine Cross
Toki is held as a prisoner by the Revengencers and suffers under their keep. While Abigail Remeltindrinc ensures him things will be fine, the band plans to rescue them. They are found by the band upon inverted crucifixes, apparently very soon to be killed. Toki rejoins the band and with their powers from the Doomstar they destroy the Metal Masked Assassin. The band holds a large concert to celebrate Toki's recovery, and Nathan proclaims Toki as a brother.</p>

                    <h3>Childhood</h3>

<p>Pickles was raised in Tomahawk, Wisconsin by his parents, Calvert and Molly. He grew up smoking "government weed" for his 'kiddie glaucoma', which he claims is what left him completely immune to the effects of most drugs. His parents' obvious favoritism and constant attention toward his older brother Seth left Pickles with an inferiority complex and resentment toward his family.
When he was six years old, his brother Seth burned down the garage and framed Pickles. That trauma is what caused Pickles to drink, which he's been doing ever since. When Pickles left home his dad's last words to him were, "Get out of here! You belong in a garbage can!"</p>

<p>Pickles suffered from asthma as a child, although stress-triggered attacks ceased after he left home.</p>
<br>
<h3>Snakes N' Barrels</h3>

<p>At the age of sixteen, Pickles rode a dust-covered bus to Los Angeles, purchased a Gibson Les Paul guitar from a pawn shop at the corner of Fairfax and Wilshire, and began a tenacious effort to become famous.[7] He landed a record deal, and gained fame as frontman for Snakes N' Barrels, a glam rock band. According to Charles Offdensen, the band already existed before Pickles got there. The band featured Antonio "Tony" DiMarco Thunderbottom, an alcoholic bass player; Sammy "Candynose" Twinskins, a crack cocaine user who played drums; and Snizzy Snazz Bullets, a hallucinogens and heroin addict on rhythm guitar. Snakes N' Barrels disbanded at the peak of their popularity due to heavy drug use. Pickles was the only member of Snakes N' Barrels to go on to a successful career, while the rest eventually regained sobriety after years of difficulty.</p>
<br>
<h3>Season 1</h3>
<p>Pickles attempts to perform a reunion show with his old band Snakes 'N' Barrels. This sparks feelings of jealousy from the rest of Dethklok, despite his assertion that he has no intention of leaving them. The concert is ultimately a disaster when his former bandmates relapse and overdose on the mind-altering drug 'totally awesome sweet Alabama liquid snake', which has no effect on Pickles due to his many years of heavy recreational drug-use.</p>
<br>
<h3>Season 2</h3>
<p>Pickles visits his family in Wisconsin for his brother Seth's wedding, an invitation which turns out to be mostly another attempt by Seth to extort money and favors from Pickles. Pickles snaps and physically attacks his brother at the wedding reception, punching him in the face.</p>

<p>Pickles is furious when he learns that his Snakes 'N' Barrels bandmates are reuniting without him under a new sober frontman, Rikki Kixx. Pickles goes to their show and confronts Rikki himself, physically assaulting him on stage.</p>
<br>
<h3>Season 3</h3>
<p>After an accident during a concert, Pickles spends a short period of time in a rehab center for his alcohol and drug use, resulting in a variety of rebellious behaviors.

When Dethklok is worried about a medical exam reflecting on them badly, Pickles convinces Murderface to drink bleach to appear in healthy.</p>
<br>
<h3>Season 4</h3>
<p>Nathan and Pickles gear up to celebrate Dethklok's newest album by partaking in a post-release tradition called The Friender Bender, a multinational worldwide drinking binge. However, their plans are halted by a series of severe storms around the world which destroy every copy of the record. Nathan and Pickles end up in a physical altercation that leaves Pickles with a bloodied nose when Nathan's premonition causes him to destroy the master record, the only remaining copy.</p>

<p>In attempt to gain his mother's approval, Pickles becomes a licensed realtor. After numerous failures, he develops a scam to buy all the houses himself. However, this still does not satisfy his mother, who immediately changes her tune and tells him how disappointed she is that he hasn't been focusing on Dethklok. He snaps and finally tells her off for the first time in his life.</p>

<p>When the band becomes stranded in the Middle East, Pickles takes the opportunity to tell Nathan he is angry about the loss of the record, and the fact that Nathan will not say "sorry" to Pickles. Nathan still does not openly apologize, saying Pickles knows it's not in his nature.</p>

<p>Pickles's friendship with Nathan is threatened even further when the two begin to pursue the same woman, their new production manager, Abigail Remeltincdrinc. Abigail and Nathan develop an attraction for each other and Pickles feels spurned and jealous. When Nathan announces that he and Abigail are a couple, Pickles quits the band on the spot and severs his friendship with Nathan entirely. Pickles refuses speak to Nathan or even be in his presence, with the exception of one final concert, at which the band is attacked and the head of their label is murdered by Mister Salacia. At the funeral, Nathan delivers an emotional eulogy in which he apologizes to Pickles for destroying the record as well as his budding romance with Abigail, explaining, "I don't want her if I can't have you... being my drummer!" The two friends share an 'emotionally brutal' hug, moments before they are all attacked by The Revengencers.</p>
<br>
<h3>The Doomstar Requiem</h3>
<p>Pickles and the band rescue Toki after he is kidnapped by The Revengencers, although it requires overcoming both fear and laziness. It is shown that in the past Pickles had even more of a leadership role within Dethklok, as he mostly called the shots about what to do after Magnus and Nathan have a falling out. At the end of Doomstar it is unclear whether Pickles has accepted Nathan's new relationship with Abigail.</p>

                    <h3>Renovationklok</h3>
<p>Magnus is seen with the band at the moment that Dethklok was signed with Crystal Mountain Records. He does not say anything and his character is not named, but this is the first indication that the band has a more varied history than previously known.</p>
<br>
<h3>Dethcamp</h3>
<p>Dethcamp shows a flashback to the early days of Dethklok that reveals a lot about Magnus' personality and why he's no longer in the band. During practice he screamed at Pickles for "making the drum pattern his own." Shortly afterwards, Magnus was involved in an altercation with Nathan Explosion where he, after being told that the band wasn't just his and that he was "acting crazy", proceeded to stab Nathan, who retaliated by punching him in the face and possibly blinding Magnus in one eye. Later the same night Nathan was woken up by Pickles saying, "You better come and check this out," who reveals that the band room and instruments had been destroyed along with "Revenge is Coming" scrawled on the walls.</p>

<p>During the episode, in an ironic twist (or perhaps in an act of measured kindness), he ends up helping Toki at Rock-a-Rooni Fantasy Camp where he is being bullied by Ludwig, one of the campers. After Toki passes out due to Ludwig forcefully shoving cake into his mouth (Toki is revealed to be diabetic in the episode Skwisklok), Magnus injects Toki with a shot of insulin to revive him. After this, Toki has a newfound respect for him and expresses interest in being his friend. Magnus does not talk to any of the other members of the band except for Pickles, whom he greets politely but coldly.<p>
<br>
<h3>Breakup Klok</h3>
<p>This episode reveals that he was fooling Toki and he is actually working with The Revengencers and the Metal Masked Assassin plotting revenge (whether or not he joined willingly is unknown given the mind control tactics Revengencers is infamous for).<p>
<br>
<h3>Church of The Black Klok</h3>
<p>In season 4 finale, Dr. Rockzo tries to warn Toki about Magnus' true nature, but Toki disregards him and attends the funeral of Roy Cornickelson with his new "friend". Magnus bids his time during the funeral until the Revengencers attack and during the panic and confusion he makes his move: he literally stabs Toki in the back in full view of the rest of the band while screaming "Revenge has come!" so they would know his intentions were malicious from the beginning. He then escapes with the Revengencers, aiding them in the kidnapping injured Toki and Abigail (though when the episode was aired, it was not clear whether they were alive).</p>
<br>
<h3>Doomstar Requiem</h3>
<p>"Doomstar Requiem" reveals that both Toki and Abigail Remeltindrinc are alive and being held prisoner by The Revengencers. Magnus seems to take particular delight in torturing and tormenting Toki, causing him to suffer greatly, though he also has an interest in keeping him alive as bait and is seen crudely stitching his wounds. When Ofdensen does not send Dethklok themselves to rescue Toki and Abigail, Magnus threatens to kill them, though this may have been a bluff to lure Dethklok into his trap. When he is alone, Magnus is shown to miss the companionship of Dethklok and he pulls out an old photo of the band in which they all look happy, revealing that there was a point in time when he was welcomed as a brother. He appears to resent Toki usurping this position. The gruesome death of Ishnifus Meaddle triggers some sort of remorse in Magnus, who begins to doubt his partner the Metal Masked Assassin even though he himself had no problem hurting people before. The Assassin does not take kindly to these protests and since he sees Magnus as having outlived his usefulness, he impales the former Dethklok member on his spear. Though his injury is almost certainly fatal, Magnus lives long enough to witness Dethklok harness the power of the Blazing Star to kill the Assassin, which leaves him awe. After seeing this, Magnus concludes that Dethklok "has the power of gods" and that he was wrong to try to stop them, at which point he commits suicide, fulfilling his role in The Prophecy.</p>
