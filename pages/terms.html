        <p>Protecting your privacy is very important to us. We are providing detailed information for you below on how we handle your data.</p>

        <br>
        <h2>1. Recording, processing and use of personal data</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>You can visit our website without giving details about who you are. We only store access data through which the user cannot be traced or identified.</p>

        <p>Personal details are only recorded if you provide such details to us voluntarily when you register for our newsletter. When you register for the newsletter, your e-mail address and, if applicable, your name (if you have provided us with it) are exclusively used for sending you the Rammstein newsletter, until such time as you unsubscribe from the newsletter. If you have given us your cell phone number, we may also inform you on Rammstein news by texting you. You may unsubscribe from this service at any time.</p>
        <br>

        <h2>2. Creating usage profiles using aliases for conducting web analysis</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>Data is recorded and saved on this website by the Google Analytics web analysis service. The data saved is used to create anonymous usage profiles with the help of aliases.</p>
        <p>
            This website uses Google Analytics, a web analysis service of Google Inc. (hereinafter referred to as “Google”). Google Analytics uses cookies, i.e. text files which are stored on your computer that enable us to analyse your use of the site. The information generated by the cookie on your use of this website is usually transferred to a server of Google in the U.S.A. and saved there. Should IP anonymisation be activated on this website, in Member States of the European Union or other contracting states of the Treaty on the European Economic Area your IP address is, however, abbreviated by Google beforehand. Only in exceptional cases is the full IP address transferred to a server of Google in the U.S.A., and abbreviated there. On behalf of the operator of this website, Google will use this information to evaluate your use of the website, in order to compile reports on the website activities, and in order to provide the website operator with further services associated with the use of the website and of the Internet. The IP address transmitted by your browser under the umbrella of Google Analytics is not integrated with other Google data. You may prevent cookies from being stored by setting your browser software accordingly. However, we would like to point out to you that, in such a case, you may not necessarily be able to use all functions of this website in their entirety.
        </p>
        <p>
            You may, furthermore, prevent the data generated by the cookie relating to your use of the website (incl. your IP address) from being recorded at Google, as well as from being processed by Google, by downloading and installing the browser plugin available at http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=de.
        </p>
        <p>
            To ensure that IP addresses are only captured anonymously and do not include any direct link to a particular individual (this is known as IP masking), Google Analytics has been extended on this website by the code “gat._anonymizeIp().
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>3. The passing on of personal details</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>In so far as is necessary for sending out our newsletter, your personal details are passed on to the company in charge of sending out the newsletter, namely Universal Music GmbH, Stralauer Allee 1, 10245 Berlin. Universal Music GmbH may not use such data for any other purpose, in particular not for its own advertising purposes.</p>
        <br>

        <h2>4. Your right to information</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>
            Under the Federal Data Privacy Act (BDSG), you have the right to be informed, free of charge, on your stored data, as well as, if applicable, a right to have such data corrected, blocked or removed.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h2>5. Encryption of personal data, data security</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>
            We take technical and organisational measures to secure our website and any other systems used by us against loss, destruction, unauthorised access, alteration or dissemination of your data by unauthorised persons.
        </p>

        <h2>6. Data privacy contact</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>
            Should you have any questions on the gathering, processing or use of your personal details, or in regard to information sought, or requests for correction, blocking or removal of data, as well as revocation of any consents granted, please write to: datenschutz@rammstein.de
